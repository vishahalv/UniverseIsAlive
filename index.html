    <h2 class="sub1">How the Universe was formed?</h2>
    <span>
        The universe was formed 13.8 billion years ago. There are many theories in the world which state the formation
        of the universe. One of the very famous theory is that of the Big Bang. It is the idea that the universe began
        as just a single point, then expanded and stretched to grow as large as it is
        right now—and it is still stretching! It tells us how we, humans, came into existence.
        <br>
        By the law of the nature, a living being emerges from a living being. Animals, birds, mammals, insects and
        plants all of them emerge from a living being. An intelligent source is able to give birth to an intelligent
        source. Humans have advanced so much through the technology that we are capable of looking at the furthest
        distances through telescopes, travel to space and what not! Hence...

        ...[In current cosmological thinking, there has been] a recent spectacular shift of viewpoint, and most
        cosmologists are still struggling to come to grips with it. If one Universe exists, then it seems that there
        must be many--very many, perhaps even an infinite number of universes. Our Universe has to be seen as just one
        component of a vast array of universes, a self-reproducing system connected only by the tunnels through
        space-time, which in this view are perhaps better regarded as cosmic umbilical cords that join a baby universe
        to its parent.
        <br>
        <br>
        But there is still a puzzle of why inflation should have just the right strength to lead to a universe like our
        own. The "natural" size for a universe is down in the sub-atomic region, on the scale of the Planck length,
        10-35 of a metre, the smallest "distance" that can exist. This is where evolution comes in.
        <br>
        <br>
        The key element that Smolin [Lee Smolin, professor of physics at the Center for Gravitational Physics and
        Geometry at Pennsylvania State University] has introduced is the idea that every time a black hole collapses
        into a singularity and a new baby universe is formed with a new space-time, the laws of physics that are born
        with it are slightly different. The force of gravity, for example, may be a little stronger--or weaker--than in
        the parent. The process, he argues, resembles the way mutations provide the variability among organic life forms
        on which natural selection can operate.
        <br>
        <br>
        Each baby universe, says Smolin, is not a perfect replica of its parent but a slightly mutated form. The
        original, natural state of a baby universe may indeed be to expand out to a few times the Planck length, before
        collapsing once again. But if the random changes in the workings of the laws of physics--the mutations--happen
        to allow a little bit more inflation, a baby universe will grow a little larger. If it becomes big enough, it
        may separate into two or more different regions that each collapse to make a new singularity and thereby trigger
        the birth of another generation of universes.
        <br>
        <br>
        Those new universes will also be slightly different form their parents. Some may lose the ability to grow much
        larger than the Planck length, and will fade back into the quantum realm. But some may have a little more
        inflation still than their parents, growing even larger, producing more black holes and giving birth to more
        baby universes in their turn. The number of new universes that are produced in each generation will be roughly
        proportional to the volume of the parent universe. "The essential point," says Smolin, "is that the universes
        that reproduce the most successfully by leaving the largest number of progeny dominate the ensemble after many
        generations."
        <br>
        The end product should be not one but many universes, all about as big as it is possible to get while still
        being inside a black hole and in which the parameters of physics are such that the formation of stars and black
        holes is favoured. Our Universe exactly matches that description.
        <br>
        <br>
        This explains the otherwise baffling mystery of why the Universe we live in should be "set up" in what seems, at
        first sight, such an unusual way. Just as you would not expect a random collection of chemicals suddenly to
        organize themselves into a human being, so you would not expect a random collection of physical laws emerging
        from a singularity to give rise to a Universe like the one we live in.
        <br>
        <br>
        Smolin has stopped short of suggesting that the Universe is alive. But heredity is one of the defining
        attributes of life, and Smolin suggests that universes pass on their characteristics to their offspring with
        only minor changes, just as people pass on their characteristics to their children with only minor changes.
        Universes that are successful in evolutionary terms are the ones that leave the most offspring. Provided that
        the random mutations are indeed small, there will be a genuinely evolutionary process favouring larger and
        larger universes...
        <br>
        <br>
        ... Before Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace came up with the idea of evolution, may people believed that the
        only way to explain the existence of so unlikely an organism as a human being was by supernatural intervention.
        The apparent unlikelikhood of the Universe has similarly led some people to suggest that the big bang many have
        resulted from supernatural intervention. Even respectable cosmologists such as Davies [Paul Davies, cosmologist
        at the University of Adelaide] and Frank Tippler of the University of New Orleans talk of the new cosmology as
        revealing "the mind of God" at work.
        <br>
        But if Smolin is right, there is no longer any basis for invoking the supernatural. We live in a Universe which
        is exactly the most likely kind of universe to exist if there are many living universes that have evolved in the
        same way that living things on Earth have evolved."
